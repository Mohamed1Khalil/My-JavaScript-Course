# My-JavaScript-Course

This web development course gave me essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to build interactive websites and apps.
Hands-on projects like a Tic Tac Toe game, calculator, and pizza menu helped solidify concepts by turning theory into practice.
I learned how HTML structures content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivityâ€”core to all modern web development.
JavaScript's role in creating dynamic user experiences and its connection to frameworks like React is crucial to my career.
These skills are directly applicable to software and web development roles, including full-stack and front-end work.
Debugging and building from scratch offered deep satisfaction and problem-solving experience.
The course emphasized real-world learning through projects, which boosted my confidence and understanding.
It built a strong foundation for advancing into more complex technologies and frameworks.
